## Object-Oriented Principles Used

| OOP Concept     | How It’s Applied                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class & Object** | `Character`, `Wolf`, `BrownieItem` classes instantiated via `new` |
| **Encapsulation** | Variables like `health`, `score`, and logic hidden inside methods |
| **Inheritance**   | `Wolf` and `Character` can inherit from a shared base class |
| **Polymorphism**  | `Move()` method behaves differently in `Character` vs `Wolf` |
| **Abstraction**   | Abstract classes/interfaces used for movable or drawable entities |
